SUMMARY:2026 Neuroscience and Resonance Webinars – Allowing Nourishment: 
 Digestion and Attachment
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260113T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260113T203000
DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to be fed—not just with food\, but with car
 e\, presence\, and attunement? In the early kitchens of our lives\, wher
 e relationships simmer alongside dinner plates\, our capacity to receive
  nourishment is formed. Was it safe to be full? Or did hunger feel more 
 familiar? We begin in the gut and the breath—where digestion\, trauma\, 
 and attachment first root themselves. Here\, we tune into the body's qui
 et knowing. We bring our attention to the gut as a place of intuition an
 d decision-making\, where attachment lives not only in feelings but in e
 nzymes\, acids\, the microbiome and the slow churn of digestion. Join Sa
 rah Peyton for a journey into the intersections of nourishment\, trust\,
  and relational metabolism.

SUMMARY:2026 Neuroscience and Resonance Webinars – The Immune System and 
 Our Relational Metabolism
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260224T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260224T203000
DESCRIPTION:Our immune systems don’t just fight off germs—they remember e
 xperiences. They carry the imprints of betrayal and belonging\, of safet
 y and suspicion. In the ecology of our bodies\, relationships leave resi
 due: inflammation\, changes and modifications to cells\, and epigenetic 
 movement. What patterns of protection and perception have become embedde
 d in our tissue? What stories does your immune system carry from the rel
 ationships that shaped you? How does your body decide what is welcome\, 
 and what must be defended against\, and how to prioritize its resources?
  What might it mean to allow nourishment again? Join Sarah Peyton for an
  exploration of the biology of boundaries and the tender intelligence of
  our inner defenders.

SUMMARY:2026 Neuroscience and Resonance Webinars – Lifelong Alarmed Alone
 ness: Approaches to Healing
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260317T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260317T203000
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the people we needed most were not there? W
 hen early echoes of absence become background noise in our adult lives\,
  shaping our sense of what connection even is? Alarmed aloneness is not 
 just a moment\; it’s a state that can settle in the bones. In this sessi
 on\, we look gently at the long arc of this pattern—the ways it shows up
  in our nervous system\, and the surprising pathways toward soothing and
  repair. Join Sarah Peyton for a dive into the roots and routes of heali
 ng from chronic relational absence.

SUMMARY:2026 Neuroscience and Resonance Webinars – Fawning\, the Vagus Ne
 rve and Ambivalent Attachment
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260421T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260421T203000
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever smiled when your heart wanted to scream? Or sai
 d yes while your body whispered no? How have we twisted ourselves to sta
 y close to love\, even when it harmed us? Fawning is the survival song w
 e learn to sing when love feels conditional. This session will look at t
 he dance between appeasement and attachment\, through the lens of the va
 gus nerve and its role in shaping our relational responses. What does yo
 ur body remember about how to stay close? And what becomes possible when
  we can rewrite that script? We meet our strategies with tenderness—not 
 to fix them\, but to understand and appreciate their roots. Join Sarah P
 eyton for an inquiry into fawning\, nervous system intelligence\, and th
 e longings underneath compliance.

SUMMARY:2026 Neuroscience and Resonance Webinars – Living in Fantasy: Esc
 apism and Avoidant Attachment
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260526T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260526T203000
DESCRIPTION:When reality feels too sharp to touch\, fantasy becomes a bal
 m. Avoidant attachment is not coldness—it is a sanctuary constructed fro
 m longing and protective distance. In this session\, we explore the cast
 les we build in the air and the roots we long to grow in the earth. What
  relationships taught us to expect too little? How does the nervous syst
 em pull away before it even knows it’s done so? What becomes possible wh
 en we see our survival strategies not as pathology\, but as creativity b
 orn under pressure? Join Sarah Peyton in a gentle unmasking of avoidance
  as both an ache and a strategy\, and a tender invitation back to presen
 ce.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260623T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260623T203000
DESCRIPTION:What does it take to soften into the now? To meet another per
 son without armoring or fantasy\, without scanning for danger or rehears
 ing disappointment? Living in reality is a brave act—a dance with trust\
 , and a flirtation with surrender. In this session\, we explore what hap
 pens when we let go of the roles we learned to play and listen instead f
 or what the moment invites. Join Sarah Peyton for a look at reality as a
  relational space\, alive with the potential for new nervous system patt
 erns and deepened trust.

SUMMARY:2026 Neuroscience and Resonance Webinars – Healing Community Iden

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260721T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260721T203000
DESCRIPTION:When trauma\, whether its natural disaster or violence caused
  by humans\, slices through a group\, what’s left in its wake? Sometimes
  numbness\, shock and silence. Sometimes shame. Sometimes we act out wit
 h violence against the people we love the most. This session invites us 
 into the collective healing of identity—what it means to be part of some
 thing larger than ourselves\, after rupture. How do we mourn what was lo
 st? How do we listen to each other’s pain without collapsing or competin
 g? Join Sarah Peyton for a journey into the relational fields of communi
 ty\, trauma\, and the slow rebuilding of trust through solidarity.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260818T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260818T203000
DESCRIPTION:As time paints lines on our faces and slows our steps\, how d
 oes our inner dialogue age with us? Is your self-relationship one of kin
 dness\, or criticism? In the aging nervous system\, compassion is not a 
 luxury. Compassion is medicine. This session reviews how the brain and b
 ody evolve with age\, and how our unconscious contracts suspend us in ju
 dgment against ourselves. Join Sarah Peyton to reflect on what it means 
 to grow older in relationship with oneself. We invite warmth\, curiosity
 \, and the possibility of rewiring old loops into new tenderness.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260922T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260922T203000
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the world feels fundamentally unsafe\, whet
 her it is too loud\, too fast\, or too much? For all of us\, the vagus n
 erve plays a crucial role in the processing of social and sensory input.
  Both autism and trauma can complicate this further\, layering distress 
 upon difference. This session gently explores the intersection of autism
 \, trauma\, and the body’s relational wiring. How can we support nervous
  systems that need something different from the world? Join Sarah Peyton
  for a session grounded in neuroscience\, resonance\, and the celebratio
 n of diverse relational rhythms.

SUMMARY:2026 Neuroscience and Resonance Webinars – Scapegoating and the E

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261027T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261027T203000
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the body expects to be blamed? To be the on
 e left out\, called out\, or cast aside? Scapegoating is a relational wo
 und that leaves deep grooves in the nervous system\, teaching us to anti
 cipate harm before it arrives. This session explores the origins of that
  wound—and the gentle\, courageous work of healing it. What does your bo
 dy believe about your place in the group? And what becomes possible when
  we interrupt the story that harm is inevitable? Join Sarah Peyton for a
  compassionate exploration of scapegoating\, belonging\, and repair.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261117T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261117T203000
DESCRIPTION:Do you ever long to have friends and partners be really inter
 ested in you? Do you love it when they can follow along with you and ask
  two\, even three questions in a row about what you are experiencing? Wh
 en we really matter to ourselves\, and our anxieties start to fade\, we 
 begin to notice when we are relationally bored\, and a new awareness can
  emerge into a subtle noticing of the quiet textures of our relationship
 s. This session invites us to explore boredom as a signal\, and to make 
 new efforts and requests\, and to be drawn toward new sorts of relations
 hips. Are we being met with curiosity? Are we extending it in return? Wh
 at happens when we turn toward our partners or friends not from fear\, b
 ut from genuine presence? Join Sarah Peyton for a deep dive into the hea
 rt of relational boredom\, and the possibility it holds for richer\, mor
 e attuned connection.
