DESCRIPTION:How do our hidden desires drive us? What is our vast\, subcon
 scious ocean of mind doing while we are living our daily lives? And what
  does neuroscience tell us about what we don’t know about ourselves? The
  part of our mind that we have access to\, the conscious mind\, can only
  catch a small percentage of what lies beneath our surface. Explore how 
 subconscious processes shape behavior\, creativity\, and decision-making
  in this 85-minute webinar with Sarah Peyton.

DESCRIPTION:What are our dreams trying to reveal to us? Are there hidden 
 messages in the night-time movies that we live in\, with their strange j
 uxtapositions and invitations? Neuroscience shows that our dreams are st
 itching our brains and our lives together. How can Emergent Constellatio
 ns give us access to the information that our Default Mode Networks are 
 surfacing in service of integrating our lives?

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260316T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260316T102500
DESCRIPTION:Are you ever surprised by things you say or do\, especially w
 hen others express pain about these things and your intention was never 
 to cause pain? When we are awake\, the Default Mode Network sustains us 
 by providing generalizations and pattern-making about ourselves and abou
 t the people we are with. This means that if we are not aware of its som
 ewhat mistaken efforts to guide us\, we can be caught up in racialized a
 nd prejudicial patterns of interpreting the world\, which block us from 
 a deeper self that moves from love. With the help of Emergent Constellat
 ions\, in this 85-minute exploration with Sarah Peyton\, participants wi
 ll catch a glimpse of their true self on the other side of their DMN.

SUMMARY:Hidden Memories\, Neglect and Trauma: an Emergent Constellations 
 View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260413T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260413T102500
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered if things happened to you that you mig
 ht not be remembering? There are a number of reasons we don’t remember t
 hings that happened to us. Sometimes it’s because the things that happen
 ed were too awful\, and we were too alone with them. But the most common
  reason for missing memory is a childhood characterized by a certain kin
 d of neglect – neglect of the body\, and of conversations about the body
 \, memory and self. More than any other modality\, constellation work op
 ens the door to reclamation of memory for both kinds of loss. In this 85
 -minute webinar with Sarah Peyton\, you will have the experience of crea
 ting a frame in which any returning memory is welcomed with compassion a
 nd gentleness.

SUMMARY:Mysticism as a Hidden Aspect of Self: an Emergent Constellations

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260511T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260511T102500
DESCRIPTION:We learn how to interface with the world\, and how to play\, 
 from our fathers\, less from what they try to teach us\, and more from t
 he way they themselves interface with the world. When there are problems
  with our father’s relationship with his world\, or with us\, it impacts
  our ability to gain traction in our lives. Constellation work is one of
  the most effective approaches to bringing change and healing to our sen
 se of father and world. This session will explore ways to bring this hea
 ling about.

DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260615T102500
DESCRIPTION:When you have an illness or injury\, do you wonder what your 
 body is trying to tell you? Do you follow up with medical treatments\, b
 ut also long for access to non-verbal wisdom? We straddle an interesting
  impasse in a world where Western medicine doesn’t have time to listen t
 o the body\, but the body still must be heard. How can we listen deeply 
 to the physical call to self that the body brings us\, with the help of 
 Emergent Constellations? Join Sarah Peyton for an 85-minute experience o
 f research and experiential exploration into the voice of the body. Faci
 litators will take away a constellation structure that supports this exp
 loration for clients.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260713T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260713T102500
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever lost time\, lost knowledge\, or found yourself 
 unaware of things a partner says they have told you? Has anyone ever sai
 d to you that you become different people in different contexts? Sometim
 es this kind of experience places us on the Dissociative Identity Disord
 er continuum\, but much more commonly\, we are simply slipping between w
 orldviews. The brain has two different ways of seeing the world – one is
  the instrumental\, or transactional lens\, and the other is the relatio
 nal lens. When we look exclusively through one or the other\, we are act
 ually in contact with very different selves. In this 85-minute workshop 
 with Sarah Peyton\, we will acknowledge and integrate our different ways
  of being. Facilitators will be given insight into this bewildering clie
 nt problem.

SUMMARY:Flow as a Hidden Stream: an Emergent Constellations View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260810T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260810T102500
DESCRIPTION:Do you love it when you fall into the state of flow? And is i
 t a mystery\, how you have arrived there? Do you tumble out of flow unce
 remoniously\, without a sense of how you’ve lost it? Would it be sweet t
 o discover that flow is a birthright state of being for each of us? In f
 low\, all stress disappears\, and we get to experience being in the mome
 nt without worrying about the future or the past. Flow is a part of what
  makes video games so compelling – they are precisely calibrated to prov
 ide the mastery that comes with practice\, together with just the right 
 amount of challenge to hold our attention\, and put us in this wonderful
  state of being. Now you might be saying\, “Okay\, Sarah\, I love flow\,
  but I don’t want to go the video game route!” In this 85-minute offerin
 g\, we will introduce and explore your relationship with flow\, constell
 ations and the sometimes-elusive state of being that makes constellation
  work one of the deepest kinds of adult play. Facilitators will come awa
 y with a new appreciation for the benefits of being a constellation faci
 litator.

SUMMARY:Finding the Intuitive Self: an Emergent Constellations View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260914T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260914T102500
DESCRIPTION:Do you sometimes wonder if your intuition has gone missing\, 
 or is untrustworthy? Did you stop trusting yourself after a moment of be
 trayal or loss\, or a grave mistake? Intuition is everyone’s birthright 
 and an essential resource for each of us. It is simply the experience of
  both of our brain hemispheres working together\, and pulling from our l
 ife wisdom to give us access to creative responses to the tasks we set f
 or ourselves. It cannot be lost. Join Sarah Peyton for an 85-minute expe
 riential workshop to reclaim your intuition\, or discover it for the fir
 st time. Facilitators will be supported in their own personal developmen
 t\, as intuition is essential for constellation work\, and receive insig
 ht about their clients.

SUMMARY:The Felt Sense of Self: an Emergent Constellations View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261012T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261012T102500
DESCRIPTION:Are you sometimes not sure you actually exist? Has it been tr
 icky to fully incarnate? If so\, it may mean that you are trying to func
 tion without having ever had enough resonant reflection to give you a fe
 lt sense of self. The felt sense is easy access to our ever-changing int
 ernal landscape\, including an awareness of sensory perceptions\, our en
 ergy patterns\, and our emotional experience. Without access to this con
 tinual feedback that we exist and that our experience has meaning\, we c
 an be lost. Join Sarah Peyton for this 85-minute workshop to create a we
 lcome for your felt-sense of self. Facilitators will gain insight into s
 ome of the missing pieces that can arise for clients struggling with a s
 ense of not existing.

DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261109T102500
DESCRIPTION:Do you feel like “you” at your present age is the same person
  you were when you were conceived\, born\, were toddling around\, attend
 ing school\, and attending college? Trauma can disrupt and interrupt our
  continuous sense of self\, leaving us without a full sense of self\, an
 d trapping some of our gifts and strengths in past memories. In this 85-
 minute class\, Sarah Peyton will offer an experiential exploration of th
 e reclamation of past selves and strengths with the help of constellatio
 n work. Facilitators attending this class will leave with a clear sense 
 of the way that healing trauma can free life energy and make it more ava
 ilable to clients.

SUMMARY:Meeting the Shadow Self: an Emergent Constellations View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261214T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261214T102500
DESCRIPTION:Do you sometimes notice that you have feelings or impulses th
 at you believe are not acceptable? Do you turn away from yourself or aba
 ndon yourself when you make mistakes or don’t have the level of mastery 
 that you long for? Are there parts of yourself that you keep hidden so t
 hat you will be loved? These experiences are often grouped together unde
 r the name\, “the shadow self.” In neuroscience\, these experiences aris
 e from conflicts between the verbal\, conscious cortex and the very non-
 verbal\, non-conscious brain parts that hold drives and habits: the amyg
 dala\, the basal ganglia and the brainstem. In this 85-minute webinar wi
 th Sarah Peyton\, we will meet the shadow self with the humility and gal
 lows humor that allow for integration and acceptance. Facilitators will 
 gain more ease with their own and their clients’ shadow selves.
