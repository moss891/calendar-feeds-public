SUMMARY:Allowing Nourishment: Digestion and Attachment
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260113T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260113T203000
DESCRIPTION:What does it mean to be fed—not just with food\, but with car
 e\, presence\, and attunement?\nIn the early kitchens of our lives\, whe
 re relationships simmer alongside dinner plates\,\nour capacity to recei
 ve nourishment is formed. Was it safe to be full? Or did hunger feel\nmo
 re familiar? We begin in the gut and the breath—where digestion\, trauma
 \, and attachment\nfirst root themselves. Here\, we tune into the body's
  quiet knowing. We bring our attention\nto the gut as a place of intuiti
 on and decision-making\, where attachment lives not only in\nfeelings bu
 t in enzymes\, acids\, the microbiome and the slow churn of digestion. J
 oin Sarah\nPeyton for a journey into the intersections of nourishment\, 
 trust\, and relational metabolism.

SUMMARY:The Immune System and Our Relational Metabolism
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260224T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260224T203000
DESCRIPTION:Our immune systems don’t just fight off germs—they remember e
 xperiences. They carry the\nimprints of betrayal and belonging\, of safe
 ty and suspicion. In the ecology of our bodies\,\nrelationships leave re
 sidue: inflammation\, changes and modifications to cells\, and epigeneti
 c\nmovement. What patterns of protection and perception have become embe
 dded in our tissue? What\nstories does your immune system carry from the
  relationships that shaped you? How does your body\ndecide what is welco
 me\, and what must be defended against\, and how to prioritize its resou
 rces?\nWhat might it mean to allow nourishment again? Join Sarah Peyton 
 for an exploration of the\nbiology of boundaries and the tender intellig
 ence of our inner defenders.

SUMMARY:Lifelong Alarmed Aloneness: Approaches to Healing
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260317T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260317T203000
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the people we needed most were not there? W
 hen early echoes of absence become\nbackground noise in our adult lives\
 , shaping our sense of what connection even is? Alarmed\naloneness is no
 t just a moment\; it’s a state that can settle in the bones. In this ses
 sion\, we\nlook gently at the long arc of this pattern—the ways it shows
  up in our nervous system\, and the\nsurprising pathways toward soothing
  and repair. Join Sarah Peyton for a dive into the roots and\nroutes of 
 healing from chronic relational absence.

SUMMARY:Fawning\, the Vagus Nerve and Ambivalent Attachment
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260428T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260428T203000
DESCRIPTION:Have you ever smiled when your heart wanted to scream? Or sai
 d yes while your body whispered no?\nHow have we twisted ourselves to st
 ay close to love\, even when it harmed us? Fawning is the\nsurvival song
  we learn to sing when love feels conditional. This session will look at
  the dance\nbetween appeasement and attachment\, through the lens of the
  vagus nerve and its role in shaping\nour relational responses. What doe
 s your body remember about how to stay close? And what becomes\npossible
  when we can rewrite that script? We meet our strategies with tenderness
 —not to fix them\,\nbut to understand and appreciate their roots. Join S
 arah Peyton for an inquiry into fawning\,\nnervous system intelligence\,
  and the longings underneath compliance.

SUMMARY:Living in Fantasy: Escapism and Avoidant Attachment
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260526T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260526T203000
DESCRIPTION:When reality feels too sharp to touch\, fantasy becomes a bal
 m. Avoidant attachment is not\ncoldness—it is a sanctuary constructed fr
 om longing and protective distance. In this session\, we\nexplore the ca
 stles we build in the air and the roots we long to grow in the earth. Wh
 at\nrelationships taught us to expect too little? How does the nervous s
 ystem pull away before it\neven knows it’s done so? What becomes possibl
 e when we see our survival strategies not as\npathology\, but as creativ
 ity born under pressure? Join Sarah Peyton in a gentle unmasking of\navo
 idance as both an ache and a strategy\, and a tender invitation back to 
 presence.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260623T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260623T203000
DESCRIPTION:What does it take to soften into the now? To meet another per
 son without armoring or fantasy\,\nwithout scanning for danger or rehear
 sing disappointment? Living in reality is a brave act—a\ndance with trus
 t\, and a flirtation with surrender. In this session\, we explore what h
 appens when\nwe let go of the roles we learned to play and listen instea
 d for what the moment invites. Join\nSarah Peyton for a look at reality 
 as a relational space\, alive with the potential for new\nnervous system
  patterns and deepened trust.

SUMMARY:Healing Community Identity and Solidarity After Trauma
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260728T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260728T203000
DESCRIPTION:When trauma—whether natural disaster or harm caused by humans
 —slices through a group\, what’s left\nin its wake? Sometimes numbness\,
  shock\, and silence. Sometimes shame. Sometimes we act out with\nviolen
 ce against the people we love the most. This session invites us into the
  collective healing\nof identity—what it means to be part of something l
 arger than ourselves after rupture. How do we\nmourn what was lost? How 
 do we listen to each other’s pain without collapsing or competing? Join\
 nSarah Peyton for a journey into the relational fields of community\, tr
 auma\, and the slow\nrebuilding of trust through solidarity.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260825T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260825T203000
DESCRIPTION:As time paints lines on our faces and slows our steps\, how d
 oes our inner dialogue age with us?\nIs your self-relationship one of ki
 ndness\, or criticism? In the aging nervous system\, compassion\nis not 
 a luxury—compassion is medicine. This session reviews how the brain and 
 body evolve with\nage\, and how our unconscious contracts suspend us in 
 judgment against ourselves. Join Sarah\nPeyton to reflect on what it mea
 ns to grow older in relationship with oneself. We invite warmth\,\ncurio
 sity\, and the possibility of rewiring old loops into new tenderness.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260922T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260922T203000
DESCRIPTION:What happens when the world feels fundamentally unsafe—when i
 t is too loud\, too fast\, or too\nmuch? For all of us\, the vagus nerve
  plays a crucial role in processing social and sensory input.\nBoth auti
 sm and trauma can complicate this further\, layering distress upon diffe
 rence. This\nsession gently explores the intersection of autism\, trauma
 \, and the body’s relational wiring. How\ncan we support nervous systems
  that need something different from the world? Join Sarah Peyton\nfor a 
 session grounded in neuroscience\, resonance\, and the celebration of di
 verse relational\nrhythms.

DESCRIPTION:What happens when the body expects to be blamed? To be the on
 e left out\, called out\, or cast\naside? Scapegoating is a relational w
 ound that leaves deep grooves in the nervous system\,\nteaching us to an
 ticipate harm before it arrives. This session explores the origins of th
 at\nwound—and the gentle\, courageous work of healing it. What does your
  body believe about your\nplace in the group? And what becomes possible 
 when we interrupt the story that harm is\ninevitable? Join Sarah Peyton 
 for a compassionate exploration of scapegoating\, belonging\,\nand repai
 r.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261117T190000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261117T203000
DESCRIPTION:Do you ever long to have friends and partners be really inter
 ested in you? Do you love it when\nthey can follow along with you and as
 k two\, even three questions in a row about what you are\nexperiencing? 
 When we really matter to ourselves\, and our anxieties start to fade\, w
 e begin to\nnotice when we are relationally bored\, and a new awareness 
 can emerge into a subtle noticing of\nthe quiet textures of our relation
 ships. This session invites us to explore boredom as a signal\,\nand to 
 make new efforts and requests\, and to be drawn toward new sorts of rela
 tionships. Are we\nbeing met with curiosity? Are we extending it in retu
 rn? What happens when we turn toward our\npartners or friends not from f
 ear\, but from genuine presence? Join Sarah Peyton for a deep dive\ninto
  the heart of relational boredom\, and the possibility it holds for rich
 er\, more attuned\nconnection.
