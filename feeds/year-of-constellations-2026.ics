DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260112T102500
DESCRIPTION:How do our hidden desires drive us? What is our vast\, subcon
 scious ocean of mind doing while we are living our daily lives? And what
  does neuroscience tell us about what we don’t know about ourselves? The
  part of our mind that we have access to\, the conscious mind\, can only
  catch a small percentage of what lies beneath our surface. Explore how 
 subconscious processes shape behavior\, creativity\, and decision-making
  in this 85-minute webinar with Sarah Peyton.

DESCRIPTION:Are you ever surprised by things you say or do\, especially w
 hen others express pain about these things and your intention was never 
 to cause pain? When we are awake\, the Default Mode Network sustains us 
 by providing generalizations and pattern-making about ourselves and abou
 t the people we are with. This means that if we are not aware of its som
 ewhat mistaken efforts to guide us\, we can be caught up in racialized a
 nd prejudicial patterns of interpreting the world\, which block us from 
 a deeper self that moves from love. With the help of Emergent Constellat
 ions\, in this 85-minute exploration with Sarah Peyton\, participants wi
 ll catch a glimpse of their true self on the other side of their DMN.

DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered if things happened to you that you mig
 ht not be remembering? There are a number of reasons we don’t remember t
 hings that happened to us. Sometimes it’s because the things that happen
 ed were too awful\, and we were too alone with them. But the most common
  reason for missing memory is a childhood characterized by a certain kin
 d of neglect – neglect of the body\, and of conversations about the body
 \, memory and self. More than any other modality\, constellation work op
 ens the door to reclamation of memory for both kinds of loss. In this 85
 -minute webinar with Sarah Peyton\, you will have the experience of crea
 ting a frame in which any returning memory is welcomed with compassion a
 nd gentleness.

 o the body\, but the body still must be heard. How can we listen deeply 
 to the physical call to self that the body brings us\, with the help of 
 Emergent Constellations? Join Sarah Peyton for an 85-minute experience o

DESCRIPTION:One of the most difficult things for us as both parents and m
 entors is to find our right place in relationship to our children or men
 tees. Sibling relationships can also be very confusing\, especially with
  favor going more to one child than another. Many things keep us stuck t
 rying to get other people’s attention\, or to make sure that others are 
 okay\, instead of being able to be grounded in our own lives\, and inste
 ad of simply being able to let the love flow through us. Constellation w
 ork teaches us where to locate ourselves\, and how to let our attention\
 , and our love\, flow through us. This session will explore ways to repo
 sition and open ourselves.

DESCRIPTION:Have you ever lost time\, lost knowledge\, or found yourself 
 unaware of things a partner says they have told you? Has anyone ever sai
 d to you that you become different people in different contexts? Sometim
 es this kind of experience places us on the Dissociative Identity Disord
 er continuum\, but much more commonly\, we are simply slipping between w
 orldviews. The brain has two different ways of seeing the world – one is
  the instrumental\, or transactional lens\, and the other is the relatio
 nal lens. When we look exclusively through one or the other\, we are act
 ually in contact with very different selves. In this 85-minute workshop 
 with Sarah Peyton\, we will acknowledge and integrate our different ways
  of being. Facilitators will be given insight into this bewildering clie

DESCRIPTION:Do you love it when you fall into the state of flow? And is i
 t a mystery\, how you have arrived there? Do you tumble out of flow unce
 remoniously\, without a sense of how you’ve lost it? Would it be sweet t
 o discover that flow is a birthright state of being for each of us? In f
 low\, all stress disappears\, and we get to experience being in the mome
 nt without worrying about the future or the past. Flow is a part of what
  makes video games so compelling – they are precisely calibrated to prov
 ide the mastery that comes with practice\, together with just the right 
 amount of challenge to hold our attention\, and put us in this wonderful
  state of being. Now you might be saying\, “Okay\, Sarah\, I love flow\,
  but I don’t want to go the video game route!” In this 85-minute offerin
 g\, we will introduce and explore your relationship with flow\, constell
 ations and the sometimes-elusive state of being that makes constellation
  work one of the deepest kinds of adult play. Facilitators will come awa
 y with a new appreciation for the benefits of being a constellation faci

 sciousness\, instead of moving through us\, is the scale and magnitude o

DESCRIPTION:Do you sometimes wonder if your intuition has gone missing\, 
 or is untrustworthy? Did you stop trusting yourself after a moment of be
 trayal or loss\, or a grave mistake? Intuition is everyone’s birthright 
 and an essential resource for each of us. It is simply the experience of
  both of our brain hemispheres working together\, and pulling from our l
 ife wisdom to give us access to creative responses to the tasks we set f
 or ourselves. It cannot be lost. Join Sarah Peyton for an 85-minute expe
 riential workshop to reclaim your intuition\, or discover it for the fir
 st time. Facilitators will be supported in their own personal developmen

DESCRIPTION:As late fall sharpens our vision\, we turn our attention to t
 he gaze. What is the difference between being seen and being exposed? We
  follow the wisdom of camouflage as a relational choice\, based on very 
 good historical evidence\, and practice attuning to the body’s signals a
 round safety\, consent\, and visibility. We work with themes such as mas
 king\, gender expression\, surveillance\, the division between public an
 d private selves\, and the refusal of the patriarchal gaze. We will lear
 n to hold presence without pressure and to honor boundaries as a sacred 
 form of knowing.

SUMMARY:The Felt Sense of Self: an Emergent Constellations View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261012T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261012T102500
DESCRIPTION:Are you sometimes not sure you actually exist? Has it been tr
 icky to fully incarnate? If so\, it may mean that you are trying to func
 tion without having ever had enough resonant reflection to give you a fe
 lt sense of self. The felt sense is easy access to our ever-changing int
 ernal landscape\, including an awareness of sensory perceptions\, our en
 ergy patterns\, and our emotional experience. Without access to this con
 tinual feedback that we exist and that our experience has meaning\, we c
 an be lost. Join Sarah Peyton for this 85-minute workshop to create a we
 lcome for your felt-sense of self. Facilitators will gain insight into s
 ome of the missing pieces that can arise for clients struggling with a s
 ense of not existing.

SUMMARY:Continuity over Time: an Emergent Constellations View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261109T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261109T102500
DESCRIPTION:Do you feel like “you” at your present age is the same person
  you were when you were conceived\, born\, were toddling around\, attend
 ing school\, and attending college? Trauma can disrupt and interrupt our
  continuous sense of self\, leaving us without a full sense of self\, an
 d trapping some of our gifts and strengths in past memories. In this 85-
 minute class\, Sarah Peyton will offer an experiential exploration of th
 e reclamation of past selves and strengths with the help of constellatio
 n work. Facilitators attending this class will leave with a clear sense 
 of the way that healing trauma can free life energy and make it more ava
 ilable to clients.

DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261120T150000
DESCRIPTION:As the season cools and darkens\, we enter the inner sanctum 
 of privacy. In this class\, we sit with the parts of ourselves that are 
 not ready to emerge and may never need to. We also bring respect and car
 e to the parts of ourselves that are hibernating\, waiting for different
  impulses for awakening. We ask\, is there difference between vulnerabil
 ity and oversharing? We attend to what is staying hidden and to what is 
 beginning to stir. We work with the slow timing of emergence and learn t
 o trust the movement of the field without forcing it forward.

SUMMARY:Meeting the Shadow Self: an Emergent Constellations View
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261214T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261214T102500
DESCRIPTION:Do you sometimes notice that you have feelings or impulses th
 at you believe are not acceptable? Do you turn away from yourself or aba
 ndon yourself when you make mistakes or don’t have the level of mastery 
 that you long for? Are there parts of yourself that you keep hidden so t
 hat you will be loved? These experiences are often grouped together unde
 r the name\, “the shadow self.” In neuroscience\, these experiences aris
 e from conflicts between the verbal\, conscious cortex and the very non-
 verbal\, non-conscious brain parts that hold drives and habits: the amyg
 dala\, the basal ganglia and the brainstem. In this 85-minute webinar wi
 th Sarah Peyton\, we will meet the shadow self with the humility and gal
 lows humor that allow for integration and acceptance. Facilitators will 
 gain more ease with their own and their clients’ shadow selves.

DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20270115T150000
DESCRIPTION:Hope is both impossible and indispensable. It buoys us up\, i
 t makes people happy\, it makes life worth living\, and at the same time
  the circumstances of the world and of our lives make it difficult to ca
 tch any hope at all. Constellations\, with their expansive and paradoxic
 al ability to reflect reality\, can take us a giant step toward the inte
 gration of life-giving skeptical hope and optimism.
