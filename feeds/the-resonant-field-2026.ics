DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260220T150000
DESCRIPTION:It is possible for representations that we hold to bring us d
 eep experiences of joy and meaning. How can we approach our work as repr
 esentatives from a stance that is most likely to open doors for us to a 
 larger understanding of the human condition?

DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260313T150000
DESCRIPTION:Once we have begun to understand unconscious contracts\, we s
 tart to notice how common they are\, and how they are the props and supp
 orts of every waking moment for most of us. How do we find ourselves in 
 such a world\, and how can we look in order to see people’s true selves 
 inside their contracts?

SUMMARY:Module 4: Healing our Sense of Mother
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260508T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260508T150000
DESCRIPTION:We learn how to love ourselves and others from our mothers\, 
 less from what they try to teach us\, and more from the way they care fo
 r themselves. The relationship with mother forms the way the inside of o
 ur brains feel\, the way we pay attention\, and the way we live. Constel
 lation work is one of the most effective approaches to bringing change a
 nd healing to our sense of mother. This session will explore ways to bri
 ng this healing about.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260612T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260612T150000
DESCRIPTION:We learn how to interface with the world\, and how to play\, 
 from our fathers\, less from what they try to teach us\, and more from t
 he way they themselves interface with the world. When there are problems
  with our father’s relationship with his world\, or with us\, it impacts
  our ability to gain traction in our lives. Constellation work is one of
  the most effective approaches to bringing change and healing to our sen
 se of father and world. This session will explore ways to bring this hea
 ling about.

SUMMARY:Module 6: Finding our Right Place as Parents/Mentors
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260710T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260710T150000
DESCRIPTION:One of the most difficult things for us as both parents and m
 entors is to find our right place in relationship to our children or men
 tees. Sibling relationships can also be very confusing\, especially with
  favor going more to one child than another. Many things keep us stuck t
 rying to get other people’s attention\, or to make sure that others are 
 okay\, instead of being able to be grounded in our own lives\, and inste
 ad of simply being able to let the love flow through us. Constellation w
 ork teaches us where to locate ourselves\, and how to let our attention\
 , and our love\, flow through us. This session will explore ways to repo
 sition and open ourselves.

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260814T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260814T150000
DESCRIPTION:When a sense that something is secret arises in a constellati
 on\, what might it point us toward? What can we do when there are secret
 s in our families or in our constellations\, and what is the neuroscienc
 e of how such things might feel\, and might affect us?

SUMMARY:Module 8: Acknowledging Scale and Magnitude in Constellations
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260911T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260911T150000
DESCRIPTION:One of the things that stops brains from integrating difficul
 t life experience\, and keeps trauma memories suspended in our daily con
 sciousness\, instead of moving through us\, is the scale and magnitude o
 f what we’ve lived through. If no one can acknowledge the enormity of ou
 r hard times\, then they continue to plague us. Once we understand this\
 , constellation work can be ideal for helping us to move through and int
 egrate our lives.

DESCRIPTION:Some of the loveliest and most nourishing things that happen 
 in life are the moments of mystery and awe. Sometimes they even happen i
 n constellations. What can we do to open ourselves to more mystery and a

DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20270115T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20270115T150000
DESCRIPTION:Hope is both impossible and indispensable. It buoys us up\, i
 t makes people happy\, it makes life worth living\, and at the same time
  the circumstances of the world and of our lives make it difficult to ca
 tch any hope at all. Constellations\, with their expansive and paradoxic
 al ability to reflect reality\, can take us a giant step toward the inte
 gration of life-giving skeptical hope and optimism.
