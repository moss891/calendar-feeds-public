DESCRIPTION:Sarah’s approach to Emergent Constellations encourages facili
 tators to integrate relational neuroscience and an understanding of rela
 tional vs instrumental language into the work. Participants learn the ba
 sics of constellation work within the framework of emergent constellatio
 ns\, and enter into a meaningful partnership with reps and clients to ha
 rvest all the wisdom that is present in the field.

DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260227T150000
DESCRIPTION:We begin with the hidden stories of our lineages. As the nort
 hern hemisphere begins to hint that spring exists\, we explore the weigh
 t of family secrets and the ways they shape belonging\, identity\, and s
 ilence. We attune to the energy of withheld truths\, unspoken shame\, an
 d the movements that arise when what was buried begins to shift.

SUMMARY:Unveiling the Hidden: The Astrological Field of Secrets
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260626T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260626T150000
DESCRIPTION:This optional additional offering invites those interested in
  astrological archetypes to explore how hidden dynamics show up in natal
  charts and transits. We will engage astrology as a relational practice 
 of listening to what is beneath the surface\, leaving behind the idea of
  astrology as a tool for prediction. Participants will learn to sense wh
 at stories are living in the chart\, what is nudging us toward conscious
 ness\, and how to meet what is emerging with care and curiosity.

SUMMARY:Camouflage and Consent: Refusing the Gaze
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260925T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20260925T150000
DESCRIPTION:As late fall sharpens our vision\, we turn our attention to t
 he gaze. What is the difference between being seen and being exposed? We
  follow the wisdom of camouflage as a relational choice\, based on very 
 good historical evidence\, and practice attuning to the body’s signals a
 round safety\, consent\, and visibility. We work with themes such as mas
 king\, gender expression\, surveillance\, the division between public an
 d private selves\, and the refusal of the patriarchal gaze. We will lear
 n to hold presence without pressure and to honor boundaries as a sacred 
 form of knowing.

SUMMARY:Hiding from Ourselves and the World
DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261120T090000
DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20261120T150000
DESCRIPTION:As the season cools and darkens\, we enter the inner sanctum 
 of privacy. In this class\, we sit with the parts of ourselves that are 
 not ready to emerge and may never need to. We also bring respect and car
 e to the parts of ourselves that are hibernating\, waiting for different
  impulses for awakening. We ask\, is there difference between vulnerabil
 ity and oversharing? We attend to what is staying hidden and to what is 
 beginning to stir. We work with the slow timing of emergence and learn t
 o trust the movement of the field without forcing it forward.
